# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **ROM detection** — `Rom` reads system properties once and recognises ColorOS /
  HyperOS / MIUI / OriginOS / HarmonyOS / EMUI / MagicOS / One UI / Android, including
  the version each vendor encodes differently (`V17.0.1.2` → ColorOS 17, `V140` →
  MIUI 14, `V125` → 12.5, `70100` → One UI 7.1). The label is shown in the dashboard,
  written to `report.json` / `report.md` as `rom`, and steers every OEM-specific hint.
- **Effect verification** — `--apply` no longer trusts exit codes. Every command is
  read back immediately and the whole batch is re-read afterwards (`verify.txt`),
  with verdicts 已生效 / 未生效 / 被拒绝 / 无法确认. `rollback.txt` now only lists
  changes that were confirmed on the device, so a rejected batch cannot leave a
  rollback file full of state that never changed. `noir block --apply` uses the same
  checks.
- **`noir adblock`** — finds the components that carry system advertising on the
  detected ROM, tiered 可停用 / 谨慎 / 别碰, and disables them with `pm disable-user`
  after per-item confirmation (`--revert` restores). Curated rows come from public
  slimming guides and are labelled as unverified; everything installed is also matched
  by package pattern, so a missing list entry does not hide a finding. Never wired into
  `auto --apply`, which stays app-ops only.
- **ColorOS rules** — OPPO / OnePlus / realme prefixes (`com.oppo.`, `com.coloros.`,
  `com.nearme.`, `com.heytap.`, `com.oplus.`) are covered in the advisor's keep-lists
  (screen recorders survive three prefix migrations) and its core-package list
  (OTA, SAU, activation, securepay, wallet, MCS). Device-verified calibration against
  a ColorOS 17 phone is still outstanding.

### Fixed

- **ad subdomains on OEM infrastructure** — `api.push.oppomobile.com` was exempt from
  blocking as a vendor domain, and the exemption was a plain substring test, so
  `ads.oppomobile.com` and `adx.oppomobile.com` were exempt too. The exemption now
  applies only when the host does not look like a tracker.
- **silent appops rejection on ColorOS** — when the device answers `cmd appops set`
  with success but leaves the mode unchanged, the terminal now says so and points at
  the ROM-specific switch (Developer options → Permission monitoring) instead of
  reporting a clean run.
- **single-package `dumpsys package <pkg>`** — the parser required two leading spaces,
  so the one-package form used by the effect recheck parsed as empty. Fixture added.
- **the device guide box** — rows were hand-padded, so any line reworded in CJK broke
  the right border. It is now built with the width-aware helpers and holds together
  from 50 to 120 columns.

## [0.2.6] — 2026-11-04

### Fixed

- **AppOps diagnostics** — `applied.txt` now keeps each command's full adb
  stdout/stderr, exit code and timeout state; failures are summarized in the
  terminal. Reports now include Android release/SDK, build id, fingerprint,
  current user, host and tool version.
- **rollback accuracy** — when an AppOp change succeeds, the previous mode is
  queried and written to `rollback.txt` instead of always assuming `default`.
- **Windows launcher** — the generated `noir.bat` switches the console to
  UTF-8 and passes UTF-8 JVM encodings, so box-drawing and CJK output render
  correctly from `installDist`.

## [0.2.5] — 2026-11-02

### Fixed

- **vendor attribution** — the package name is now authoritative, and host
  fallback scores vendors by suffix instead of "first substring wins".
  Infrastructure hosts (`schemas.android.com`, `github.com`, …) are ignored, and
  OPPO / vivo / Huawei / Samsung / Meituan / Pinduoduo / JD / Bilibili / Kuaishou /
  Weibo were added. Fixes hundreds of apps being labelled Google. Reported in [#12].
- **domain export** — split into `domains-trackers.txt` (safe to block),
  `domains-other.txt` (review) and `domains-functional.txt` (push/login/update/
  payment/store/cloud; do not block). Bare IPs, `localhost` and test/staging
  hosts are dropped; `domains.txt` now contains only the tracker tier.
  Reported in [#11].

## [0.2.4] — 2026-11-01

### Changed

- scan progress is now streamed from the device and redrawn **once per APK**
  (spinner + ETA), instead of once per batch of eight

### Docs

- dashboard screenshot (`docs/screenshot.png`) in the README

## [0.2.3] — 2026-11-01

### Fixed

- `--apply` in a non-interactive run (piped stdin, CI) now refuses to execute
  unless `--yes` is also passed. `deepscan --apply` previously skipped the
  confirmation because it only prompted on a TTY.

## [0.2.2] — 2026-11-01

### Changed

- build: Gradle wrapper 9.8.2, Kotlin 2.4.21 (both plugins pinned to the same version)
- CI: `actions/checkout@v7`, `actions/setup-java@v6`, `actions/upload-artifact@v7`,
  `actions/download-artifact@v8`, `softprops/action-gh-release@v3`

No user-facing behaviour changed in this release; it exists to validate the
upgraded release pipeline.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-11-01

### Fixed

- **dumpsys runtime permissions** — lines ending in `, flags=[…]` or `; flags=[…]`
  were dropped, so apps holding granted location / camera / microphone never
  entered the candidate list. Reported in [#9].
- **device-side extraction** — `unzip -p apk 'classes*.dex'` is not portable; some
  vendor builds (Huawei/HarmonyOS) do not expand entry wildcards and return
  nothing with exit code 0. The scanner now names `classes.dex … classes15.dex`
  explicitly, and pulls the APK for host-side parsing when nothing is extractable.
  Reported in [#10].
- **cache invalidation** — endpoint cache is versioned (`endpoints-v2.tsv`) so
  results produced by the broken extraction are not reused.
- **Windows portable** — `Start NOIR.bat` now runs the bundled
  `runtime\bin\java.exe` directly with UTF-8 console settings, and jpackage is
  built with `--win-console`; the release workflow smoke-tests `NOIR.exe --version`
  on Windows, `NOIR` on Linux and the `.app` binary on macOS.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-11-01

### Added

- manifest-level audit via an in-house AXML parser (no external dependency):
  exported components without a permission, `usesCleartextTraffic`, `allowBackup`,
  `debuggable`, `targetSdk`, `networkSecurityConfig`
- data-type correlation: each permission is mapped to the data it exposes
  (location / contacts / SMS / calls / mic / camera / screen / apps / identity /
  files / calendar / accounts) and joined with upload hosts — `leaks` in the report
- shared-UID section: lists packages that share one Linux uid and therefore hold
  the union of each other's permissions
- SDK / tracker fingerprinting from domains and decompiled class paths
  (Umeng, Firebase, AppsFlyer, Adjust, Meta, ByteDance, Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu,
  Sogou, iFlytek, Sentry, Mixpanel, OneSignal, Bugly, Getui, JPush, MiPush …)
- deeper code signals: `SystemProperties.set`, SMS APIs, device-id getters,
  WebView bridges, accessibility / notification-listener / device-admin services
- deepscan risk now includes manifest exposure (exported services/receivers/providers,
  cleartext + upload endpoint, backup, debuggable)

## [0.1.2] — 2026-11-01

### Fixed

- deepscan: skip decompiled library code (androidx / kotlin / okhttp / gson …) when
  counting signals — the filter used paths relative to the output root instead of
  `sources/`, so `Class.forName` in androidX was inflating `reflection`
- deepscan: surface a `jadx exit != 0` as an error instead of silently scoring an
  empty output directory

## [0.1.1] — 2026-11-01

### Added

- `noir deepscan` — pull + decompile the riskiest apps in parallel and score
  code-level signals (`exec`, dynamic loading, app disabling, accessibility
  rewriting, screen capture, reflection, crypto, networking)
- `--apply` / `--purge` cleanup flow after DeepScan, with per-app confirmation
- decompilation cache keyed by package + APK path
- portable, double-clickable builds with a bundled runtime (jpackage):
  `Start NOIR.command` / `Start NOIR.bat` / `Start-NOIR.sh`

### Changed

- multiple connected devices: a physical device is preferred over an emulator;
  interactive runs ask which one to use

## [0.1.0] — 2026-11-01

### Added

- `noir scan` — inventory every app with INTERNET + sensitive permissions
- endpoint extraction from APKs on-device (`unzip | strings`), with a pull-based fallback
- classifier (telemetry / ads / security / AI / location / IME / carrier …) and vendor attribution
- risk scoring based on permissions, endpoints and system/privileged status
- `noir ui` — adaptive monospace dashboard (CJK-aware width, ANSI gradient, `--ascii` fallback)
- `noir auto` — plan + `--apply` for reversible app-ops, plus `plan.txt` / `rollback.txt`
- `noir deep <pkg>` — pull one APK, run jadx, grep for red-flag calls
- `noir block <pkg…>` — print or apply neutralisation commands with restore hints
- `noir setup` — download `adb` / `jadx` into `~/.noir/tools` when missing
- `noir doctor` — environment check
- guided first run when invoked without arguments
- device onboarding: developer-mode / USB-debugging instructions, 180 s wait loop,
  dedicated messaging for `unauthorized`
- `noir --about`, `noir --version`
- shared-UID aware `dumpsys package` parser (system-uid permissions live in a separate section)
- endpoint cache keyed by package + APK path
- cross-platform CI on Ubuntu, macOS and Windows
- release workflow producing signed-checksum zip archives per OS

### Known limits

- static analysis only: it proves capability and endpoints, not actual traffic
- app-ops cannot revoke `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` or device identifiers
- DNS-level blocking is exported as `domains.txt`, not applied
